# APIs and SDK

## 1. Explain API types

**API:** *An API (application programming interface) is a piece of programming code that allows data to be transferred between different software products. It also includes the terms of the data transfer.*

### **API types :**

1. *Open APIs: Open APIs, also known as Public APIs, have no limits on who can use them because they are open to the public.*

2. *Partner APIs: In order to use this sort of API, a developer must have particular permissions or licenses, as they are not available to the general public.*

3. *Internal APIs: Internal APIs, also known as Private APIs, are exclusively accessible by internal systems. These are generally created for a company's internal usage. This sort of API is used by the company's many internal teams to develop its goods and services.*

4. *Composite APIs: These APIs integrate many data and service APIs into one. It is a set of tasks that run synchronously as a result of their execution rather than at the task's request. Its major tasks are to improve the performance of listeners in web interfaces by speeding up the execution process.*

## 2. Explain the benefits of APIs

1. *Automation: APIs allow computers to handle tasks rather than individuals. Agencies can use APIs to improve work flows to make them more efficient and productive.*

2. *Application: Service and information delivery can be more versatile because to APIs' ability to access app components.*

3. *More flexibility: an API may be used to construct an application layer that can be used to disseminate information and services to new audiences and can be customized to provide unique user experiences.*

4. *New data is now available: an API allows all government-generated data to be made available to all citizens, not just a chosen few.*

5. *Efficiency: When an API is accessed, the material created may be instantly published and made available across all channels. It makes it easier to share and distribute it.*

6. *Integration: APIs enable incorporating data from any website or application more easier. This allows for a more fluid delivery of information as well as a more integrated user experience.*

7. *Personalization: APIs allow any user or business to personalize the information and services they consume most frequently.*

8. *Adaptation: needs change over time, and APIs help predict these shifts. When this technology is used, data transfer is made easier and information is reviewed more completely. In a word, APIs provide for more flexibility in service deployment.*

## 3. Analyze the differences between API and SDK

*SDK is a development tool for apps, whereas API is an interface that allows software programs to connect with one another. It's similar to a basic SDK, but without the ability to develop apps. Rather, it serves as a link between these programs. Consider an API to be a library that gives access to software or hardware. SDKs are a lot more involved. They comprise a set of application development tools like as compilers, libraries, debuggers, and integrated development environments (IDEs). In other words, an SDK is a comprehensive set of tools, but an API is only a user interface. SDKs are like sentences that have been put together, while APIs are like words that you can use.*

|             |API | SDK|
|------------ |------------ | ------------ |
|Purpose |An application programming interface (API) that connects and integrates applications. | A collection of developer tools. |
|Characteristics |Compact, quick, and generally specialized. | More robust, with a plethora of tools. |
|Use Case |It's used to add particular functionalities to a program. | It's used to create new apps or to add a lot of features to an existing one. |
